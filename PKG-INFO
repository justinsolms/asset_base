# asset_base

A package for obtaining, managing and provision of financial securities meta-data and time-series data.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install asset_base
```

## Usage

  - The package is at an early stage of development.
  - There may still be some bugs.
  - There is a good test suite which was used to develop the package. It is therefore a development test suite, not a use qualification test suite centred around the user. That still needs to be done. Code coverage analysis also needs to be done.
  - The package is fairly well documented in the docstrings but still need a proper Sphinx document body.
